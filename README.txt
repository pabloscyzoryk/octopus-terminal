Hi!

I'm happy you decided to test octopus-terminal software.
Here are some things you should know before you start:

Default password to access octopus is "szczur" (you can eaisly change it in ./client/src/index.ts)

After you use pkg to build the app, you might sometimes see the Fetch API experimental warning.
It's because of the way pkg works, and it's not a problem.
I hope one day they will fix it.

Let me know if you encounter any problems with babel while building the app (npm run build / pnpm build)
and if you know a way to fix them easily. (it took me quite a while and I don't even know what I did to fix it)
